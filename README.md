# Building-fast-queries-on-CSV

The goal of this project was to create a class that represents our inventory of laptops. The methods in that class will implement the queries that we want to answer about our inventory. We experimented with different approaches to the query methods to improve the time and space complexity of the classes and functions within the classes so that our queries run faster and more efficiently.
